DISCLAIMERS

For our beta release of the HealthNet application, we tried to most of the key features. These are the features we have currently implemented.

- Patient Registration
- Administrator Registration
- Update Patient Profile Information
- Update Patient Medical Information
- Create or Update Patient Appointment
- Cancel Patient Appointment
- Appointment Calendar
- Add/Remove Prescriptions
- Viewing Patient Medical Information, Prescriptions and Tests and Results
- Release Test Results
- Logging System Activity
- Admission and Discharge to/from Hospital
- Viewing Activity Log
- Viewing System Statistics
- Patient Transfer
- Upload Patient Information
- Send Private Message

Unfortunately, things don't always work how we want them to. Here is a list of known bugs currently in the HealthNet system:

- Unable to link to another patient in our system as an emergency contact
- Unable to check if a newly created appointment or updated appointment overlaps with a
  previously made appointment, so overlapping appointments can be made
- You are able to enter two accounts with the same email if the case is different
  (DoctorA@test.com & doctora@test.com are seen as different credentials so it is allowed to be done)
- Administrator is able to change its role to any of the other roles(Patient, Nurse, Doctor)
- Insurance is required for employees when it should not be
- Unable to add images or files to Medical Tests when uploading them
- Unable to view system statistics in HealthNet
